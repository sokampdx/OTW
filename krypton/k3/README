Krypton 2

ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher.

Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm.  In this example
of a substitution cipher, we will explore a 'monoalphebetic' cipher.
Monoalphebetic means, literally, "one alphabet" and you will see why.

This level contains an old form of cipher called a 'Caesar Cipher'.
A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number.  For example:

plain:	a b c d e f g h i j k ...
cipher:	G H I J K L M N O P Q ...

In this example, the letter 'a' in plaintext is replaced by a 'G' in the
ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext 'bad' becomes 'HGJ' in ciphertext.

The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3.  It is in 5 letter
group ciphertext.  It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher.  Without any 
further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break.  You do 
not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program 
that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key.  
If you think logically, this is completely easy.

One shot can solve it!

Have fun.
